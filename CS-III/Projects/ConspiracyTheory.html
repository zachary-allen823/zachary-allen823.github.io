    <h1>Conspiracy Theories</h1>

    <h2>Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h2>
    <p>When we are on the internet, most websites will have certain programs running in the background that make note of what you click on, buy, watch, etc. They then take that information and use it to bring similar videos and products to the forefront of users' platforms. In doing this, the algorithm makes it more likely for users to interact with a given platform thus generating more revenue and other statistics such as watch time.</p>

    <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>
    <p>Because recommendation algorithms are always learning what users are most likely to interact with, it creates an environment where it considers what users like, and recommends similar content based on that. Then, it looks at which of those recommendations users choose and filters to be more similar to that. It almost creates a recursive function. If the function is filtering the content, the recursion would be filtering the previous filter over and over again adjusting itself to users' interactions. This allows for incredibly productive revenue streams, but it also creates issues. The algorithm can not tell good from bad or biased from unbiased. It goes with whatever the user is interacting with. This means that unbiased content is going to be filtered out in most cases in exchange for more filtered content likely based on the views of the user as that is most likely the view they tend to click on more.</p>

    <h2>Conspiracy Theories and Algorithmic Amplification</h2>
    <p>The feedback loop's inability to filter neutrally lends itself to other problems. In fact, because of recommendation algorithms prioritizing of content that will be the most engaging, long and controversial topics are more likely to be recommended and because of this, the feedback loop takes effect in driving even more sensational topics. One of the head leading types of content like this are conspiracy theories. Because of the in depth, fanatical mind gymnastics a lot of these theories take, length of content is generally longer leading to more ad revenue, and a lot of controversy will surround these theories. Humans love controversy and drama which is why things like reality TV are so popular. However, humans also love to take sides. This is why the feedback loop allows for more biased content to appear. This coupled with recommendation algorithms prioritizing controversies and conspiracy theories makes for an easily started wildfire of misinformation biased to certain views and wild stretches based on limited facts.</p>

    <h2>Platform incentives</h2>
    <p>As previously stated, conspiracies and controversies are massive for many platforms. It drives clicks and watch time which boost revenue for the platform or company. However, this means that most platforms have no reason to limit the spread of false information because that would mean limiting what conspiracies are shown to users. Human greed makes it so that misinformation has virtually no obstacles and the recommendation algorithms only help them to reach as many audiences as possible.</p>

    <h2>Potential for Exploitation</h2>
    <p>Because of the advantages of exploiting the recommendation algorithms and user feeback loops, less than trustworthy users are more inclined to be more dramatic or even lie to their audiences for the sake of appearing on more users' pages. This is why the rise of clickbait is so incredible. Too often, feeds and recommended pages are flooded with flashy titles with dramatic titles in all caps sensationalizing some controversial topic; it's because it generates the most clicks and shares and because of that, algorithms tend to push this content to more users in larger quantities regardless of the content and that is why many people do not know all of the facts in a lot of issues. Bias and straight up lies skew information and make it hard to descern what is real or not. Conspiracy theorists and untrustworthy content creators can essentially write their own reality to generate revenue and not only is it greedy, but creates a danger for humanity's future.
