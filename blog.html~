    <h1>3-May-2023: BYOD and technology policy</h1>
    <p>The BYOD policy change is ultimately going to prove to do more harm than good for students of Allen ISD. For starters, many students bring their own device as the school provided Chromebooks run very slowly and lag a lot compared to a student's own laptop. Part of this is the addition of secure browsers which is fair for tests and secure assignments, but for everyday work, efficiency is worth the sacrifice to security. Additionally, the removal of the BYOD network as a whole is going to slow things down even further because of school population. Allen has had three networks in the past: Guest, BYOD, and CB. Guest and BYOD are the most commonly used as CB is only used by school issued Chromebooks. Therefore, the removal of BYOD will effectively double the number of users on AISD-Guest meaning it will cause slow internet speeds which will interfere with learning and work as a whole. Because of these factors, I believe the move to remove the BYOD network is a hasty and rushed response to AI software such as Chat GPT as well as the use of non-educational technology in general.</p>
