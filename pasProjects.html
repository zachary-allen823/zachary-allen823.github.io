<h1>Past Projects</h1>
<p>This was my big project I did with two other classmates at the end of CS-I</p>


<h2>Concept</h2>

<p>The goal of the project was to recreate the popular arcade style mobile game flappy bird in which a player taps the screen to cause a bird to fly up slightly and time their hops to navigate through a series of holes between pipes. This loop repeats until the bird hits a pipe or the ground.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>My group was motivated by our combined love for the old game and the belief that we could recreate it even with our rudimentary skills. Despite the game's simplicity, there was a lot more under the hood than I had iinitially expected, but I enjoyed the process.<p>
  
<h2>Samples and Explanations</h2>

<p>The following are samples of code taken from the actual project and I will be explaining their purpose.</p>

<p>This segment of code was something we made ourselves for the game that wasn't in the original. Through the 's' key, players could make the pipes move up and down independently of one another making for a more challenging experience. The variable called offsetValue is the variable that determines if the pipe is moving up or down by being changed to a negative or positive depending on whether or not the pipe has reached the maxiumum position in either the up or down direction.</p>
