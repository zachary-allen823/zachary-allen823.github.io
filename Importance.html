  <h1>Why is my portfolio important to me?</h1>
  
  

    <p>By developing a digital portfolio, I can display all of what I learn and create in the field of computer science. This will be useful for future pursuits such as job interviews that will be able to see not only my achievements, but also see my abilities at work with the portfolio itself.</p>
