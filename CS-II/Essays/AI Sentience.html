  <h1>AI Sentience</h1>

  <p>&nbsp;With a rising increase in technology, computers continue to impress the world with what they can do. We have even managed to create self replicating, self improving programs known as Artificial Intelligence or AI. However, AI is not Skynet from Terminator. Humans have not advanced that far quite yet. However, AI has its benefits and its drawbacks along with its advocates and opposition, and the day may come where one day, AI becomes so advanced we will be able to call it alive.</p><br>

  <p>&nbsp;Sentient AI may have its benefits to humanity, but left unchecked, it could be a problem. However, the first thing to point out is that it is difficult to define what setient AI is due to the complex nature of what it is to be sentient. As of today, the current most advanced AI systems have the ability to imitate sentient qualities to a certain extent and even adapt to perform actions based on certain perameters. One example of this is the AI system, DALLE-2, which can make a 3-D image based on any description given and can even interpret loose descriptions or concepts such as "infinite joy" and make a rendering of its interpretation (Author name, 2022, p. 3).</p>
