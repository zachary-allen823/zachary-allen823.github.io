    <h1>Fingerprints</h1>
    
    <p>In and HTTPS connection, the 'S' stands for secure and this is certainly true. The objective of these connections is to ensure that no data is altered by a hacker and to ensure that a user is acessing an authentic website and not a copy or fake.</p>
    
    <p>An https proxy is a tool that runs encryption and decryption while staying hidden from both the server and client. It allows for safer security when accessing a website.</p>
    
    <p>An MITM stands for Man in the Middle and is a form of cyberattack in which a connection is intercepted or interrupted by the perpetrator. The attacker connects to a communication between a client and a server and either listens in or even cuts the connection and sets up a new one. This can be used to steal data such as credentials or personal information as well as spy on clients and corrupt data.</p>
    
    <p>A hash is a function that takes large sized values and converts them into smaller and more comprehensible values. A good hash must be able to process data quickly and minmize the amount of duplicate values in ouput.</p>
    
    <p>A CA, or Certificate Authority, is used to authenticate a server's legitimacy. Without it, a client would not be able to tell the difference between a legitimate server and a clone or malicious one seeking to do harm to them.</p>
    
    <p>SSL interceptions can not be reliably prevented, but there are methods to detect them.</p>
    
    <p>A certificate's fingerprint is the key to detecting any interceptions because any spoofed certificates will not match the true certificate's fingerprint. Any changed aspect will lead to a completely different fingerprint making it impossible to fully hide that it is spoofed.
      
    <p>A false positive is when an alarm is set off by activity that is actually legitimate while conversely a false negative, the more dangerous of the two, accepts activity that is actually malicious and shouldn't be allowed.</p>
    
    <p>A school has the right to track school account communications but nothing else. The government should not be allowed to track communications without probable cause and while this may delay law enforcement reaction time, people will be able to be confident in their own privacy. However, an internet service provider should not be allowed to track communications as that is a mssive breach of a customer's privacy with no justifiable reason.</p>
