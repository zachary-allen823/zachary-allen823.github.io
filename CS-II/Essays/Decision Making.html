    <p>Similarity Bias</p>
    <p>Similarity Bias is the preference to choose something that is more familiar to us rather than to accept something new or different. Because of this, it is unlikely that when given the choice, a person will choose a new concept as opposed to something they have not done before. This will have affected my ISP as early as the selection stage as I chose the project that was to create a game which is what I did last year. Additionally, the group responsible for the creation of this project are people that I am familiar with thus making the group more appealing to me. As for how it will affect the development of the project, it may cause us to make things that may not be as novel or exciting as we will want to stick to safe features that we know for fact we can code. To overcome this, I will try to further my knowledge and do research to cover ideas that I may not be able to do on my own initially.</p>

    <p>Planning Falacy</p>
    <p>Procrastination is a huge problem to any project and this one will be no different. We may underestimate how long it will take to finish our project thus leading to rushed development at the end which could leave the game full of bugs and errors that would make for a very unsatisfying product. To avoid this, punctuality and early starting is necessary. I need to get in touch with my group and start formulating a plan to start working early on in order to ensure maximum time to iron out all issues ensuring a truly successful project.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Progress Bias</p>
    <p>It is easy to get caught up in success especially when it comes to the slow process of game development. Finishing one aspect or feature of the project can allow the group to get complacent especially if it was a particularly difficult or long segment. The completion may cause the progress of the rest of the project to grind to a halt as we underestimate how much was actually done. To avoid this, there needs to be some sort of checklist that actually objectifies how many things we have done regardless of the size or complexity of any one feature.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Expedience Bias</p>
    <p>Human nature causes us to always want immediate results and our morale can drop when things are taking a long time. As coding takes some time to perfect and create, morale of the group may not remain high especially if a feature is taking a long time to finish or if something is slowed due to difficulty or complexity. To avoid this, again, a checklist that quantifies what we have done can help show our true progress. Additionally, if something is taking a long time to complete, finding another aspect of the project that needs to be finished may need some priority or it can be used as a way to take the mind away from the monotony of focusing on one task for too long.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Safety Bias</p>
    <p>Most successful endeavors involve some form of risk. Without a risky or bold move, there is no novelty or innovation. As for Tempora, there are many features that may be difficult to achieve to the point of maybe even being too ambitious for a group of CS-II students to accomplish. Propositions to cut content and play it safe may allow for a more streamline development, it makes for a less interesting final result. To overcome this, we need to do research into other games and see what concepts and coding they use to use similar features to what we want to have.</p>
