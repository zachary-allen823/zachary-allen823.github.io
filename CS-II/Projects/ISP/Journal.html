    <h2>17 April, 2023</h2>
    <p>Plans: This week I plan to make sure that all of my pulled files are up to date and hopefully work with images.</p>
    <p>Significant Achievements: <a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-Tempora/issues/28">Issue Link</a></p>

    <center><img src="Issue28.png" alt="Issue 28" style="width:50%"></center>

    <p>Challenges: Scheduling this week was difficult because of a band trip keeping me out of school on Monday making it two more days before I had clarification on what I needed to do. Additionally, I still have to wait for the images mentioned in the above issue #28 before I can truly test whether our code is working or not.</p>

    <h2>20 March, 2023</h2>
    <p>Technical Challenges: I have little way to contribute to my project due to the fact that there is litle in our github for me to check and make suggestions for. My group has not seemed to have done much in the way of coding and as such, I do not know where to begin in making uggestions.</p>
    <p>Scheduling Challenges: This week saw a continued trend of lack of communication and as such I am very much out of the loop with the progress my team is making. I assume at this point that we are likely quite a bit behind on progress and we need to pick up the pace with our project in order to make sure we have a product ready to submit at the due date.</p>
    <p>Interpersonal Challenges: Over a month in, I still don't even know everyone involved with my project. Communication is still bad as the group chat hasn't really been used for anything productive to the project for some time now. We need to communicate and lay out a plan for what we are going to do moving forward in order to finish on time.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h2>13 February, 2023</h2>
    <p>Technical Challenges: This week brought up not a challenge but rather a dilemma. I found that we could not agree on what coding language and what software we wanted to use for the project. This is a problem because at this stage we should already know these things and be preparing to begin actual development. Figuring this out needs to be our number one priority as we need to get started very soon.</p>

    <p>Scheduling Challenges: This week was hard because with presentations, it was hard to coordinate what parts were done and what parts were not especially across class periods. Getting the presentation accessible for everyone was an issue which was also harmed by the fact that I was not in the shared drive (See Interpersonal Challenges) and as such had no clue what was going on or if the presentation would be ready for this week.</p>

    <p>Interpersonal Challenges: I found this week that I was not on the shared google drive and there was in fact a different person in the drive in my place. It has been resolved, but I have to catch up and understand all of the charts in the drive. This could have been avoided if not for our lack of communication when the drive was published and if we confirmed whether or not everyone could access it.</p>

    <h2>6 February, 2023</h2>
    <p>Technical Challenges: We've yet to truly determine what features we are going to implement and as such, we can not even plan what language, what technology, and other technical aspects that we are going to use. Without a clear plan it is going to be impossible to even start coding and without code we have no project. We need to get a plan set in stone within the nect couple of weeks otherwise we risk fighting an uphill battle to finish on time.</p>

    <p>Scheduling Challenges: Without a clear plan of what will be in the project, we have no way of creating a timeline for what we need to finish coding and by what time. We only have around two months to complete the project and we need to get started as soon as possile with the actual creation of a product.</p>

    <p>Interpersonal Challenges: Communication is still an issue. We have no updates on how the planning is coming as all of the concept work is being done by one team member. This team member has done very little to communicate outside of his class and as such, I have very little idea as to what progress they have made. We need to streamline communication and that team member needs to start being more communicative if the process is to go smoothly.</p>

    <h2>23-Jan-2023</h2>
    <p>Technical Challenges: So far I do not really know what we are going to add as far as coding or what knowledge we will need to complete our project. As such, I do not really know where to begin in coding or what I need to go over. The best way to get around this will be to coordinate in a google slides or google doc what we need and what features we will add to the project.</p>

    <p>Scheduling Challenges: Finding time to work together and figure out what we are going to do is difficult given the variety of schedules in our group. Between different class periods, different activities we are involved with, and a lack of cohesion within the group, scheduling time to communicate has proven difficult. We need to get better at communicating with one another and start getting on top of how we are going to handle the time differences in order to be successful.</p>

    <p>Interpersonal Challenges: While there are no problems to be fair, there is still the fact that we have no group cohesion with one another due to our still unfamiliarity with one another and as such a lack of communication. As stated previously in this entry and in others, communication is proving to be the biggest problem in every category. Once we get that under control, the process should streamline itself out a little bit.</p>

    <h2>16-Jan-2023</h2>
    <p>Techical Challenges: This week was a slow week and therefore there weren't really any technical challenges to overcome. However, looking forward, I think that the biggest challenge in the near future will be the issue of making sure everyone will be able to push and pull to GitHub. Due to the unpredictable nature of technology, it is likely that we will encounter similar issue to one that plagued our group last week. To solve this, we just need to stay on top of making sure all members' systems are working and if not, get them fixed as quickly as possible as to not lose time.</p>

    <p>Scheduling Challenges: We still have yet to plan out how we are going to divide up work and/or if we are going to get together or work together outside of class. Since we haven't gotten much momentum on our project, this is the hardest thing schedule wise to get going with. We simply need to communicate with each other and lay out what we are going to do.</p>

    <p>Interpersonal Challenges: Again, without much time spent on the project, we have not had any interpersonal issues outside of not getting to know each other. As stated before, many of us do not know each other which will make group cohesion a bit harder than it would be otherwise. We still simply need to get to know one another or at the very least work on the project together and get used to each other's work styles.</p>

    <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
    <p>Technical Challenges: The first technical challenge has presented itself in the form of some people being unable to pull the README file to add their name and portfolio URL. Those affected will need to fix this issue before we can continue otherwise this challenge will snowball into many worse problems. With even one person unable to make changes anywhere other than in their own terminal, we risk being unable to finish the project as we do not have time to have a person copy them. The team member I know that has this issue will need to seek out teacher aid to fix this issue.</p>

    <p>Scheduling Challenges: So far, the spread of the team across at least three class periods is already proving troublesome. Little communication has been given so far regarding this week's assignment and I can not communicate in person as I am isolated in my own class period being the only member of my group in third period. Luckily, as of the time of writing this entry, a group chat has been made rougly thirty minutes ago which effectively solves the issue for the most part and I do not believe that it will be an issue again for some time if ever.</p>

    <p>Interpersonal Challenges: While there have been no conflicts among team members yet (apart from some mild teasing), but the main interpersonal issue is the fact that many of the team members remain unacquainted with one another. As of this week, I believe our group has had a sixth member added in fifth period bringing the number of people in the group from fifth period up to five of the seven as opposed to four out of six. Who this person is I do not know as I am only familiar with two members of my group and I only currently share a class with one of those two to my current knowledge. I believe that we will either need to get to know each other through the group chat or meet in person either to work or just get to know the group.</p>

    <h2>2-Jan-2023</h2>
    <p>Software Engineer: This is the most common role associated with a coding project. This is because a software engineer, or software developer, is the person actually writing the code of a project allowing for its mechanics to exist in the first place. While not the only role involved, a software engineer could argue that they are the most important part of a project since without them, there is no one to build the inner workings of the software. It would be like making a clock without someone to make the gears. You would only have a shell and that is why software engineers are crucial to a software related product. This is a role I can probably do pretty well as I find myself to be good at coding. The hardest part for me however would be relearning some aspects of swift and IGIS as I do not believe that my current knowledge of their workings of what I need to complete the project are sufficient as of now. Codermerlin will be a valuable tool here as I can go back to the lessons covering what I need.</p><br>
    <p>QA Engineer (Quality Assurance): A quality assurance engineer is a member of the team responsible for checking the work done by the software engineer and ensuring that a product is of high enough quality in performance to release to consumers. Their job is to create tests and scenarios that may be applied to software and making sure that it can comply and accomplish any relevant tasks. In addition to testing the performance capabilities of a product, a QA engineer is also responsible for debugging code and suggesting and making changes as necessary. A QA engineer needs to have good communication and problem solving skills as well as the ability to work with a team. This along with Software engineer would be one of the better roles for me. I like the development aspect of a project, not the release and management of it. My biggest hurdle would be learning how to optimize code and learning good debugging methods which I can learn via research and internet tips.</p><br>
    <p>Project Manager: A project manager is the head of a team during the development of a product or service. They are responsible for everything logistics wise in a project including scheduling, planning, budgeting, and allocation of resources. As such an important role, a project manager must have good leadership and communication as well as a good sense of time management given that they are responsible for deadlines. I think I could handle this role, albeit with some challenges. My biggest of which would be time management. That would be a skill I will need to work on if I decide to take this role.</p><br>
    <p>Product Manager: Similar to a project manager, the product manager is responsible for overseeing the performance of a product. However, the product manager oversees the product from the perspective of a businessman rather than a developer. A product manager is responsible for identifying a need from a consumer and assigning development of a project to suit those needs. I think I could fill this role but maybe not as well as other team members. My area of adeptness is the development of an idea in terms of coding not the inception of the idea based on outside demand. My biggest challenge would be making suggestions for changes to the product based on guesses of what someone else would want to see. To counter this, I would ask around to others nearby but outside of my project what they would like to see based on the game description.</p><br>
    <p>Release Engineer: Sharing communication with a software engineer, a release engineer communicates all of the requirements needed for a product to be released. This includes how code will be compiled and the overseeing of deployment of a product. In short, a release engineer manages the delivery of a product developed by a software engineer. I do not think I would be well suited for the role as I feel that while I can understand aspects of the code and their purpose, I do not find myself well suited to organize and optimize anything for full release. As such, my main challenge would be to learn how to organize and compile code for release all together.</p><br>
