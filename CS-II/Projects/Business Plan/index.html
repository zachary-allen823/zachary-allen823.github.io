    <h1>Business Plan</h1>

    <h2>Identity</h2>
    <p class="projects">Tempo Trainer is a product that aims to assist in the training of young drummers with tempo maintenance (preventing rushing and dragging) when playing.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p class="projects">New drummers have a large tendancy to rush when playing and this is very hard to correct if not learned early.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p class="projects">Tempo trainer teaches new drummers how to stay in time by testing how their playing matches with a given tempo.</p>

    <h2>Target Market</h2>
    <p class="projects">The target market of tempo trainer will be new drummers and their instructors. However, this product can be used to a certain degree with other musicians too.</p>

    <h2>Competition</h2>
    <p class="projects">Our competition will be other metronome apps and services that may be cheaper/free to buy which may be a draw away from Tempo Trainer. However, our product will have the draw of actually telling the player if they are actually in time or not.</p>

    <h2>Revenue Streams</h2>
    <p class="projects">Revenue will come from consumers directly with product sales which will include the device of the metronome and the pad which can be connected to the device for input. As the hardware aspect is fairly simple, there is not much for the consumer to buy.</p>

    <h2>Marketing Activities</h2>
    <p class="projects">Tempo Trainer will be advertised in music and percussion stores and online with social media and advertising.</p>

    <h2>Expenses</h2>
    <p class="projects">Expenses will be from development of the timing system itself as well as the cost of electronics to build the device as well as materials for the pad such as rubber and mesh for the pad heads.</p>

    <h2>Team and Key Roles</h2>
    <p>As of right now the team consists of just the creator of the project, Zach Allen, but there are plans to include more people to develop the system and help build the hardware both of which will be assisted by Allen.</p>

    <h2>Milestones</h2>
    <p class="projects">>As Tempo Trainer proves to be a reliable teaching tool for tempo maintenance, we aim to have it be a widespread tool used up into the high school level.</p>
