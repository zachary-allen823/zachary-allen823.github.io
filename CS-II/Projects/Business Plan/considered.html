    <h2>Consdidered Projects</h2>
    <button class="projects"; onclick = "window.location.href='https://www.codermerlin.com/users/hamza-ebeida/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html';">ID Attendance Scanner</button>
    <p>This idea was very strong and very applicable in the life of students. I found a convincing argument in wanting to improve the efficiency of taking attendance. I see multiple reasons why this would help such as assisting with substitues and speeding the process along allowing for more class time. Ultimately however, I chose to reject this projects because of issues relating to contact and the fact that the class period difference leaves several challenges that I feel would interrupt communication and thus the progress of the project.</p>
    
    <button class="projects"; onclick = "window.location.href='https://www.codermerlin.com/users/srijishnu-devarapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html';">RFID School Security</button>
    <p>This project is ambitious and very similar to the last one. Both involve the scanning of student IDs when entering, but this one serves the purpose of security rather than attendance. This is definitely a good idea for countering multiple issues around the school such as preventing potentially harmful people from entering and making life more convenient for security. However, this project seems to be less reliant on their own coding and more aimed at the hardware side of things. As stated, you can simply buy an RFID scanner so you wouldn't have to program it and so I don't see much experience to be gained here.</p>

    <button class ="projects"; onclick = "window.location.href='https://www.codermerlin.com/users/benjamin-haines/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html';">City Planner</button>
    <p>I like the idea of a city planner for a community especially one like Allen which has a large population that I feel can be uninformed about events. Through this app, leaders can bring the community together through more events with more people knowing about them which should help with event attendance. However, for me, this idea seems fairly simple in concept and I would like to maybe do something a little more advanced and that is why while I support the project, I have rejected making it mine.</p>


    <button class="projects"; onclick = "window.location.href='https://www.codermerlin.com/users/david-ortega/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html';">Personality and Mental Health Quiz</button>
    <p>I see where the goal is here. Helping people with mental health problems is certainly a noble cause and would be a great benefit to the world. I know one of the members of this team pretty well and I like what he is doing. The reason I am rejecting the idea is because I honestly do not find making a quiz interesting as all of the research will be scientific and coding the project I feel would not be very hard. Personality quizzes are fairly common and making one would not be the challenge I am looking for.</p>

    <button class="projects"; onclick = "window.location.href='https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jacob-jershin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html';">3D Ray Tracing Game</button>
    <p>The idea is there and I like the concept of optimizing the running of 3D games and I even almost was a part of this group from the start. The issue I have is not with the project itself but rather myself. I've seen the algorithm, and the math involved is way over my head and I simply feel that I would be an obstacle here. Contrary to some projects that I feel were not as complex as I wanted, I think I need more experience before tackling this projects.</p>

    <button class="projects"; onclick = "window.location.href='https://www.codermerlin.com/users/juneyoung-hwang/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html';">Virtual Drum Testing</button>
    <p>I like drumming and I think this is a problem with percussion selling websites as a whole. It is hard to know for sure what a product will sound like until you get it unless you go out of your way to watch a separate review. This idea is a matter of convenience for sellers and consumers allike. My only downside is that my interests lie in concert and marching percussion and not jazz and drumset. I'd put more consideration into this project if it was expanded to include more items such as accessory instruments (cowbell, vibraslap, etc.) as well as maybe mallet types. However, since the main focus is not of much interest to me, I am going to reject it but keep it as an alternative.</p>

    <button class="projects"; onclick = "window.location.href='https://www.codermerlin.com/users/layne-yarbrough/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html';">Eagle Eats</button>
    <p>This is another project I was very close to accepting. I have experienced firsthand the chaos of the cafeteria and it has once resulted in me not getting lunch. The idea is from a friend of mine and would be a convenience to everyone involved. I feel it would speed up the cafeteria lines quickly as students will not be standing around considering what to get. It may only be seconds difference for each student, but those seconds add up quickly and would benefit everyone. This is a great idea but I think that I would like to pursue something different. Ultimately though, I would consider this my second choice.</p>

    <button class="projects"; onclick = "window.location.href='https://www.codermerlin.com/users/rafid-ahmed/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html';">Bug Tracker</button>
    <p>For beginner coders, this would be a lifesaver. The idea of giving novice programmers a system to help them keep track of bugs and errors would most certainly be useful. My issue is the ambiguity. What counts as a bug? Is it including errors or perhaps only tracking errors? Is there a way to track what would likely be unintentional bugs? The scope of this project is what I find the biggest problem and ultimately why I am rejecting it.</p>



    <button class="projects"; onclick = "window.location.href='https://codermerlin.com/users/zachary-allen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html';">Tempo Trainer</button>
    <p>I am a active percussionists which is the what the inspiration of my idea comes from. I would love to make something that could be incorporate into a program I am passionate about. However, my project has huge ambiguity to tempo related issues which would have to be solved by complex algorithm and that is something I feel I am not quite ready for yet and while I could do this project in the future or do it as an alternative, I have chosen not to pursue this project this year.</p> 


    <button class="projects"; onclick = "window.location.href='https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-bhuta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html';">Tempora Game</button>
    <p>The idea already clearly has a lot of thought and care put into it. I see more effort and potential here than most of the projects. Additionally, I like the game design process. Additionally, the team has people I have gotten to work with before. I think I could fit into this team well and that is why this is my top choice for projects this year.</p>
