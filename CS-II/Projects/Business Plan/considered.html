    <p>This idea was very strong and very applicable in the life of students. I found a convincing argument in wanting to improve the efficiency of taking attendance. I see multiple reasons why this would help such as assisting with substitues and speeding the process along allowing for more class time. Ultimately however, I chose to reject this projects because of issues relating to contact and the fact that the class period difference leaves several challenges that I feel would interrupt communication and thus the progress of the project.</p>

    <p>This project is ambitious and very similar to the last one. Both involve the scanning of student IDs when entering, but this one serves the purpose of security rather than attendance. This is definitely a good idea for countering multiple issues around the school such as preventing potentially harmful people from entering and making life more convenient for security. However, this project seems to be less reliant on their own coding and more aimed at the hardware side of things. As stated, you can simply buy an RFID scanner so you wouldn't have to program it and so I don't see much experience to be gained here.</p>
